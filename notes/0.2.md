- Cross Build for Scala 2.10 and 2.11.
- Updated Scalaz Stream to 0.5a version.
- `putG` operation is deleted (you can compose operations, so is not necessary).
- Change usage of `mutable.OpenHashMap` to `immutable.Map` for operation result.
- `Map` as result will not contains `null` as element to ensure that you will get a `None` in that case.
- Added internal conversion for inner Map as result, e.g `queryAggregate[Map[String, java.util.HashMap[String,Long]]]` in aerospikez 0.1, now is `queryAggregate[Map[String, Map[String, Long]]]`.
- Fixes in Documentation.
